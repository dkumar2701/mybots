# Assignment 6

My code is built on the evolution code from previous assignments and thus running search.py will still print out a fitness based on the current fitness function, which can be ignored for this assignment. Running search.py will generate a random jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized snake with a length between 2 and 6 blocks. Each block has random dimensions, each of which may be between 0.25 and 1. Additionally, each block has a 50% chance of being a sensor, in which case its color will be green rather than the standard blue. The axis of each joint is also randomly chosen between the x, y, and z direction 

TO RUN THE CODE:

Run search.py. The current settings are 0 generations with a population size of 1. Because this is still build on the evolution code, running search.py will create two simulations, each with a different randomly generated snake.
